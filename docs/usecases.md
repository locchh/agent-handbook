# Use cases
Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown of **when and why** you might choose each of these options, depending on your goals, complexity, and system requirements:

### 1. üîπ **Single LLM (Language Model Only)**

‚úÖ **Use when:**

* You need pure text-based capabilities: answering questions, summarization, translation, simple code generation, etc.
* Inputs and outputs are **only text** (no images, audio, video, or structured data).
* The task is **stateless** (no memory of past interactions needed).
* Example: Chatbots, document search, simple coding assistant.

‚ùó Limitations:

* No memory of past context beyond prompt.
* Can‚Äôt handle non-text inputs (images, files, etc.).
* No external action-taking (can't browse, call APIs).

---

### 2. üîπ **Multimodal LLM (Text + Images/Audio/Video)**

‚úÖ **Use when:**

* You need to process or generate **multiple types of data** (e.g., images + text, video + text).
* Example tasks:

  * Image captioning
  * Document QA with images
  * Medical imaging explanation
  * Video summarization
* You still want a **single model to handle everything end-to-end**.

‚ùó Limitations:

* Still **stateless** by default (does not plan or act beyond the response).
* Doesn‚Äôt manage complex workflows or multi-step tasks.

---

### 3. üîπ **Agent (LLM + Tools + Memory)**

‚úÖ **Use when:**

* You need the system to:

  * **Reason and plan** (multi-step thinking).
  * **Call tools/APIs/plugins** to take action (e.g., retrieve documents, run code, update databases).
  * **Maintain memory** across sessions.
* Example tasks:

  * Autonomous research assistant
  * Task automation
  * Complex decision-making bots

‚ùó Limitations:

* Complexity increases.
* Coordination between tools can be fragile if not designed carefully.

---

### 4. üîπ **Agent + MCP Servers (Agent + External Context Control)**

‚úÖ **Use when:**

* You want the **agent‚Äôs context and tools to be dynamically configured** or controlled externally.
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** allow:

  * Central management of system prompts, tools, memory, datasets, etc.
  * Decoupling of context logic from the agent itself.
* Example:

  * An enterprise system where **multiple users** need **personalized agents**, but you manage everything centrally via MCP servers.
  * You can update prompts/tools without redeploying agents.

‚ùó Limitations:

* Requires setting up **MCP server infrastructure**.
* More moving parts, but more flexibility.

---

### 5. üîπ **Multi-Agent (Each One Connects to Multi MCP Servers)**

‚úÖ **Use when:**

* You need to solve **complex problems requiring specialization**, coordination, or scalability.
* Each agent:

  * Has its **own skills, role, personality**.
  * Uses one or more MCP servers to load context/tools **on demand**.
* Example:

  * A **team of AI agents** (doctor agent, finance agent, legal agent) working together on a case.
  * Large-scale autonomous workflows (e.g., AI project managers, AI developers, AI testers in a loop).

‚ùó Considerations:

* More complex orchestration.
* Need for **communication protocols** between agents.
* Need for **resource control** (prevent cost overruns).
